## About Me

I architect data systems and conduct quantitative research at the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data visualization, and quantitative finance. Through my blog [smaddanki.com](https://smaddanki.com), I explore the synergy between robust data infrastructure and sophisticated analytical methods. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource hub, combining practical code implementations, detailed technical analyses, and in-depth tutorials across these domains.
